## Running
This project requires Python 3 and the requests package
I don't need to pip install for math because this is part of the Python Standard Library. It's enough just to run the import. For requests though, I need to first run pip install, then I can import it. Because requests is a module in the PyPi (Python Package Index)
'pip install requests'
'python find_meteors.py'
